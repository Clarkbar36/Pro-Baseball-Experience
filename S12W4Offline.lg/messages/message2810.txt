MiLPBE News: The Offseason Begins
Wait until next year!
That is the battle cry for the fans of all but one MiLPBE team. While the 2027 champs get to brag to their buddies about the championship, it's time for general managers to rehash last year and figure out ways to improve their teams. It is the offseason in baseball. The diamonds and the stadiums are void of activity, but the front offices are bristling with energy. Good teams want to stay good -- bad teams want to get good -- and all teams want to get better.

So get ready for the ecstasy of a superstar savior's signing, the joy of re-signing a valuable performer, but also the heartbreak of losing a bidding war or saying farewell to that retiring vet. Nothing is happening on the field, but off the field, the offseason is rarely dull.

You may now vote for the league award winners, the option is available in the league menu.
