Week's Best Player: Anchorage's Grinz
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Jake Grinz:player#472> of the <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Grinz rocked opposing pitching for a .474 average (9-for-19), 1 home run and 3 RBIs to come away with the award.

Batting .364 to date, Grinz has 2 home runs and 24 RBIs.
