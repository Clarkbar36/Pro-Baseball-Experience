"The kid had it all working last month," a veteran teammate told reporters. "He keeps up those kind of numbers, we might have to start inviting him out with us after the games."

The 20-year-old reliever threw like a veteran. In no relief appearances he raked in no saves and 9 strikeouts in 19.1 innings as he put together his 2-0 record and 1.86 ERA.
