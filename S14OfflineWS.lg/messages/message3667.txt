Line Whiffs 16, Vancouver Tops Nashville
Everything was working for <Blu Line:player#446> today at Gibson Soundstage. He had the perfect delivery. The ball was moving. The circle change was working.

In an unforgettable performance, the 25-year-old Line fanned 16 Stars and sparked the <Vancouver Vandals:team#11> to a 10-1 victory over <Nashville:team#27>. He left Stars hitters mumbling and muttering at the plate. And when he needed a strikeout, he got it.

"I don't know if there are many times that I've seen him throw better," said Vancouver manager  . "His location and command were really something." 

In addition to collecting 16 strikeouts over 9 innings, Line allowed 4 hits and 1 walk in a superlative outing. 

"I thought I'd make it easy on the guys today," Line said with a smile.

For this year <Line:player#446> has chalked up 11 wins and 7 losses in 18 starts with 147 strikeouts in 114.2 innings and a 3.53 ERA.
