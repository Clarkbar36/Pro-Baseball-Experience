This Week's Star Player is Turtle
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Tomato Turtle:player#734> of the <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Turtle rocked opposing pitching for a .550 average (11-for-20), 2 home runs and 7 RBIs to come away with the award.

Currently Turtle is batting .243 with 7 home runs, 43 RBIs and 31 runs scored.
