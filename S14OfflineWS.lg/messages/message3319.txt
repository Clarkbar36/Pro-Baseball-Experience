Smart Takes This Week's Trophy
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Mac Smart:player#558> of the <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Smart rocked opposing pitching for a .579 average (11-for-19), 2 home runs and 7 RBIs to come away with the award.

In the current season, <Smart:player#558> has put up a .317 batting average with 72 hits, 6 home runs, 38 runs batted in and scored 34 runs.
