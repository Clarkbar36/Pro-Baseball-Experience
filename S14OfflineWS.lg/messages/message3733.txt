Utah Clinches Wild Card
The <Utah Railroaders:team#25> celebrated wildly tonight as the team officially captured a wild card position in the Pro Baseball Experience.

"In some ways you're more excited than if you would have won the division, because you know you were closer to being left out of the playoffs," said reliever <Colben Fairborn:player#466>. "It's not lost on our guys that once the playoffs start we're going to have to step things up and play our best."

The Railroaders have a 48-49 record and will be looking to turn their wild card berth into the franchise's 1st World Series win.
