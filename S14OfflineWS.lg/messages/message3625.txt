Crabs Pitching Ravaged by McBantershire
A jubilant <Laddy McBantershire:player#275> joined the postgame press conference at The Treehouse today to offer some unusual words of encouragement -- for the <Providence Crabs:team#3> pitching staff he had just vanquished.

"It may not have looked like it," said the <San Antonio Sloths:team#9> catcher, "but I saw some awful good pitches today. If luck hadn't been on my side it might have turned out a lot different." 

That would not have been the conclusion of anyone who saw his dominant 5-for-6 hitting performance, which led the Sloths to a 18-9 win.

"He made it look easy," said  , manager of the Crabs. "We never figured out what to do with him. Obviously."

<Laddy McBantershire:player#275> singled in the 2nd, singled in the 3rd, grounded out in the 5th, singled in the 6th, singled in the 7th and hit an RBI single in the 8th.

Thus far in 2030 McBantershire is hitting .236 with 6 home runs, 12 RBIs, 15 runs scored and has compiled a .287 OBP.
