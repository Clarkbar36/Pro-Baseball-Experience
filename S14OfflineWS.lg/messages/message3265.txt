Forty-Three Befuddles Dallas
"That was one of my best outings," said <Jose Forty-Three:player#462>. "I was worried a lot in the bullpen. My ball wasn't quite right. Luckily, it can be two different worlds -- the bullpen and the game. Once I stepped on the field, it all fell into place."

It was an impressive start for the Wheelers hurler. He blanked the Dynamos 12-0 on a strong 3-hitter while ringing up 6 strikeouts and doling out 2 walks.

So far this year <Forty-Three:player#462> has nailed down no saves. His won-lost record is 6-1 with a 3.36 ERA.
