Florida Captures Pro Baseball Experience Eastern Division Crown
It's official! The Florida Space Rangers have secured the top spot in the Pro Baseball Experience Eastern Division. <Florida:team#24>'s manager was quick to give credit to his players.

"They believed in this team all year, and never gave up."

It won't be an easy road for Florida as they try to compete for their 1st World Series victory. They have to hope that their success will translate to the post-season, which is certainly not always the case. This was the 3rd division title for the team.
