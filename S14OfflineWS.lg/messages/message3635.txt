State College's Alpin MiLPBE Star of the Week
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Bob Alpin:player#598> of the <State College Swift Steeds :team#18> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Alpin rocked opposing pitching for a .450 average (9-for-20), 1 home run and 2 RBIs to come away with the award.

This season <Alpin:player#598> is hitting at a .395 pace with 2 home runs, 7 RBIs and has scored 6 times.
