Big Bat Pays Off, Alpin Player of the Week
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Bob Alpin:player#598> of the <State College Swift Steeds :team#18> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Alpin rocked opposing pitching for a .429 average (9-for-21), 2 home runs and 2 RBIs to come away with the award.

Presently <Alpin:player#598> is hitting .406 with 4 home runs and 9 RBIs. He has played in 15 games and scored 11 times.
