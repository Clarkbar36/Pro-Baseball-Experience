MiLPBE News: Playoffs begin
The quest for the Minor League PBE Rookies Finals championship gets underway today. The regular season is now over and the so-called "second season" begins. For fan and player alike this is the sweetest part of the season -- the Rookies Round 1. The baseball experts have made their predictions, but teams will do it or die on the diamond. The best team doesn't always win -- sometimes it's the lucky team that is fated to win the crown -- sometimes it's the team that gets hot late in the season that wins -- and sometimes talent wins out and takes the glory. The winner will be one of these teams: 
<Amarillo Armadillos:team#19> (BYE) and <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> versus <Kingston Mounties:team#17>.
