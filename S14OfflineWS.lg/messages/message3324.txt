Aviators End Borthwell's Streak
<New York:team#1> third baseman <Weldon Borthwell:player#29> came into today's game against the <Outer Banks Aviators:team#2> on a hot streak. He left on a cold one.

The Aviators did their jobs well, beating the <New York Voyagers:team#1> 1-0 and holding Borthwell hitless to snap his 20-game hitting streak. The 27-year-old third baseman had a few words to say after finishing 0-for-3, telling reporters only that he "came up short."

"What <Weldon:player#29> did was exciting and quite an achievement," said Voyagers manager  . "It's tough enough to get one hit in this league, much less go 20 games in a row. I'm even more proud of the way he handled the press coverage. He never let the frenzy get to him or affect his play."

Borthwell is hitting .339 this year with 13 home runs and 49 RBIs. He also has an OBP of .434, 35 walks and scored 47 times.
