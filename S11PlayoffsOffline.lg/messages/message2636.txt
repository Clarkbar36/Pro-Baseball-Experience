Minor League PBE Selects Best Performer
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Mountain Thunderfist:player#451> of the <Amarillo Armadillos:team#19> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Thunderfist rocked opposing pitching for a .556 average (10-for-18), 2 home runs and 11 RBIs to come away with the award.

This season <Thunderfist:player#451> has hit at a .336 clip with 30 RBIs, 4 home runs and 19 runs scored.
