MiLPBE Player of the Week Chosen
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Jonny Times II:player#524> of the <Kingston Mounties:team#17> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Times II rocked opposing pitching for a .333 average (5-for-15), 5 home runs and 10 RBIs to come away with the award.

So far this year <Times II:player#524> has hit .261 with 16 home runs, 45 RBIs and 50 runs scored.
