Space Rangers Shut Out Crabs, Jabs Winner
There was no spell, no black magic -- just good pitching.

<J.A. Jabs:player#399> of the <Florida Space Rangers:team#24> blanked the <Providence Crabs:team#3>, 6-0, at USSSA Space Coast Coliseum today, and he did it the old-fashioned way. After finishing the 1-hit, complete-game shutout, he was all smiles.

"I threw a lot of my pitches for strikes in this game," Jabs said. "I mixed it up and tried keeping these guys off balance."

Jabs walked 2 and struck out 8 in the victory.

"He was throwing his breaking ball for strikes and we never capitalized on any of his mistakes," Crabs manager   said later.
