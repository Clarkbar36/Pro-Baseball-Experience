Boss Launches Number 200
<Utah:team#25> defeated <Providence:team#3> today 6-4 and took some of the joy out of <Mike Boss:player#171>'s 200th career home run.

"I just wanted to get a good swing on the ball all day," <Boss:player#171> said. "And I did."

Despite the loss, it was a good game for the 34-year-old Crabs first baseman. He had 1 hit, scored 1 run and had 1 RBI.

The Railroaders manager said, "You could see he was aggressive up there. The worst thing we did was throw him a strike. It probably would have been better if we threw the ball outside of the strike zone every time he came to the plate because he seemed like he was in a hurry to get it over with."

Over his career <Boss:player#171> is batting .277 with 200 home runs and 592 RBIs. In 1019 games he has delivered 1126 hits, scored 599 runs, stolen 0 bases and gotten on base at a .343 clip.
