MiLPBE Announces Player of the Week
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Buddy Cooper:player#562> of the <State College Swift Steeds :team#18> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Cooper rocked opposing pitching for a .400 average (8-for-20), 3 home runs and 8 RBIs to come away with the award.

<Cooper:player#562> is presently batting .329 with 7 home runs, 18 runs scored and 25 RBIs. His OBP is .372.
