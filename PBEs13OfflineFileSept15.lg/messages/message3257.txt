June's #1 Batter Announced
It's perhaps an award he'll win many more times through his career, as at age 17 <James Love:player#625> has a lot of baseball ahead of him.

But for now the young <State College Swift Steeds :team#18> star can enjoy the numbers he put up in June, which have garnered him the nod as the Minor League PBE Batter of the Month.

His breakout month featured a .382 average with 4 home runs, 25 RBIs and 15 runs scored.
