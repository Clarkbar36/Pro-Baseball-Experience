PBE Player of the Week Awarded
20-year-old <Bryan Barnes:player#482> sent shock waves through Pro Baseball Experience last week with an eye-popping performance that brought him the Pro Baseball Experience Player of the Week Award.

A newcomer to the league, <Barnes:player#482> made the establishment sit up and take notice, punishing opposing pitchers with a .429 average, 9 hits in 21 at-bats, 3 home runs and 6 RBI.

Where the <Utah Railroaders:team#25> catcher goes from here, only the baseball gods know for sure, but <Barnes:player#482> certainly made his mark last week.
