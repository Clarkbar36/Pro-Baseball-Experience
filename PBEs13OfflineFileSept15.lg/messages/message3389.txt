Scorpions Are Champs of Pro Baseball Experience Western Division
It's official! The Death Valley Scorpions have secured the top spot in the Pro Baseball Experience Western Division. <Death Valley:team#10>'s manager was quick to give credit to his players.

"They believed in this team all year, and never gave up."

It won't be an easy road for Death Valley as they try to compete for their 2nd World Series victory. They have to hope that their success will translate to the post-season, which is certainly not always the case. This was the 6th division title for the team.
