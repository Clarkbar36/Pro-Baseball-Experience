Playoff Bound: Sloths Win Wild Card
While the winners of the wild card are never considered favorites to win the World Series, that's not the way <Julian O'Sullivan:player#246> sees things.

"I think we've got the best chance to win the championship, because I know how good we are and I know how good we can be when we play well," the catcher said after his team clinched a wild card berth. "I wouldn't want to play us in the playoffs - I'll put it that way."

Whether it's simply bravado, or a sign of things to come, San Antonio will be heading into the playoffs seeking the 5th Pro Baseball Experience championship in team history.
