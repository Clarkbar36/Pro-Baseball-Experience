Swift Steeds  End Nawx's Streak
<Revan Nawx:player#637>'s 21-game hitting streak has now come and gone. It was snapped today as the <Kansas City Hepcats:team#28> suffered a 6-2 setback against the <State College Swift Steeds :team#18>.

Nawx went without a hit in 2 trips to the plate. He was visibly upset during a postgame press conference, but it appeared that the streak had little to do with it.

"The hitting streak was one of those things where it was fun while it lasted, but I'm not going to lose any sleep about it tonight," he said. "On the other hand, I am going to lose sleep about dropping this game today."

<Nawx:player#637> on the season is batting .323 with 3 home runs. His totals include 32 RBIs and 30 runs scored. He has played in 68 games.
