June's Best MiLPBE Hurler is Delabar 
Any time a rookie makes a splash on the scene, it's got to be great for his career potential. Just ask <Thomas Delabar:player#534>, who put together a stellar month out of the pen. The <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> closer, 23, kept the opposition off balance all month as he held them to a .243 average and walked away with the Minor League PBE Pitcher of the Month award for June.

Delabar posted a 4-1 mark and a 2.75 ERA in no relief appearances. In 36 innings, he had no saves, 14 strikeouts, and 6 walks.
