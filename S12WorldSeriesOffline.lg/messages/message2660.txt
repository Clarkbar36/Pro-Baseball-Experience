MiLPBE Honors Anchorage First Baseman
So far in his young career, <Thomas Trey Oudekerk:player#508> has kept a low profile, but after his performance at the plate last week, he attracted the notice of the rest of the Minor League PBE in a big way as he was named the Player of the Week today for his efforts.

The 21-year-old <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> first baseman hit at a torrid .333 clip as he collected 8 hits in 24 at-bats, 3 home runs, 8 RBIs and 4 runs scored.

Thus far this year <Oudekerk:player#508> has hit .333 with 16 home runs and 48 RBIs.
