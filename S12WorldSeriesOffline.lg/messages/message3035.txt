MiLPBE Player of the Week Awarded
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Oliver Dieudonne:player#564> of the <Amarillo Armadillos:team#19> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Dieudonne rocked opposing pitching for a .706 average (12-for-17), 2 home runs and 6 RBIs to come away with the award.

This year <Dieudonne:player#564> is hitting .327 with 3 home runs and 22 RBIs to his credit. He has gotten on base at a .389 clip and scored 24 runs.
