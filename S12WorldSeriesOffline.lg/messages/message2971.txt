Kingston's King MiLPBE's Best
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Chris King:player#516> of the <Kingston Mounties:team#17> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. King rocked opposing pitching for a .600 average (15-for-25), 2 home runs and 11 RBIs to come away with the award.

So far this season <King:player#516> has gotten 66 hits in 191 at-bats for a .346 batting average with 9 home runs. His stats include 33 RBIs and 34 runs scored. He has played in 46 games.
