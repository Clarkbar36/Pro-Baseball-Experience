June's Top Hurler is Banks
Despite the number of years he's been in the league, <Mookie Banks:player#27> still gets excited when he puts together a quality stretch like he had in June. The 28-year-old starter for <Outer Banks:team#2> was named Pro Baseball Experience Pitcher of the Month earlier today.

He collected 5 wins and no losses with 41 strikeouts in his 6 starts, putting up a fine 1.45 ERA in 43.1 innings of work.
