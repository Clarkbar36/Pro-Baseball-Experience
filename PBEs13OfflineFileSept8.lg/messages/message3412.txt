Wild Card Clinched by Vancouver
Although they may be heading to the postseason as wild card winners, there's no shortage of expectation on the <Vancouver Vandals:team#11>.

"We expect to win the World Series, simple as that," starting pitcher <Greg Steiner:player#76> said bluntly after his team officially wrapped up a Pro Baseball Experience wild card spot.

Should the team make good on those expectations, it will be the 6th World Series title in franchise history.
