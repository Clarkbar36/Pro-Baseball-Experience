MiLPBE Star of the Week Chosen
So far in his young career, <Chris King:player#516> has kept a low profile, but after his performance at the plate last week, he attracted the notice of the rest of the Minor League PBE in a big way as he was named the Player of the Week today for his efforts.

The 20-year-old <Kingston Mounties:team#17> second baseman hit at a torrid .400 clip as he collected 4 hits in 10 at-bats, 2 home runs, 5 RBIs and 3 runs scored.

For the season <King:player#516> is hitting .348, batted in 38 runs with 11 home runs and 37 runs scored.
