Lamar on a Tear, Hits for Cycle
<Vancouver Vandals:team#11> first baseman <Hendrix Lamar:player#407> hit for the cycle today at Vandal Dome but his great game was soured as the <Death Valley Scorpions:team#10> went home victors by a score of 9-7.

Lamar accomplished the rare feat, chalking up 4 hits -- 1 single, 1 double, 1 triple and 1 home run -- on his way to finishing 4-for-8 with  4 runs batted in and 2 runs. He told reporters in the postgame press conference that he did not know what he had achieved until he was informed by the Vancouver PR staff following the game.

"As long as the game is going, it's hard for me to think about anything but what is on the field," he said. "It's a nice accomplishment, I guess. I wish it had been under better circumstances."

<Hendrix Lamar:player#407> flied out in the 1st, hit a three-run home run off <Elston Sinclair:player#208> in the 3rd, hit an RBI triple in the 5th, singled in the 7th, flied out in the 8th, flied out in the 10th, doubled in the 13th, walked in the 15th and struck out in the 16th.
