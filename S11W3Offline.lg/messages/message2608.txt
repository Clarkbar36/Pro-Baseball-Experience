Player of the Week: Drumbo of the Wheelers
So far in his young career, <Randy  Drumbo:player#483> has kept a low profile, but after his performance at the plate last week, he attracted the notice of the rest of the Minor League PBE in a big way as he was named the Player of the Week today for his efforts.

The 18-year-old <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> catcher hit at a torrid .350 clip as he collected 7 hits in 20 at-bats, 3 home runs, 10 RBIs and 3 runs scored.

For the season <Drumbo:player#483> has produced 20 hits in 85 at-bats for a .235 average with 8 home runs and gotten on base at a .278 clip.
