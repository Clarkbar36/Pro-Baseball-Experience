MiLPBE News: Regular Season ends
The 2028 Minor League PBE season has ended. Most clubs and most players are headed home for the year, but a few good teams will head to the playoffs, which are slated to start soon. They will get a chance to be the league's champion. All they have to do is win the Rookies Finals -- a not-so-easy task. To win it takes a combination of good pitching, good defense and timely hitting -- and occasionally some lucky bounces of the ball.
