Nakamura Earns MiLPBE Player of the Week
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Shinji Nakamura:player#641> of the <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Nakamura rocked opposing pitching for a .450 average (9-for-20), 2 home runs and 9 RBIs to come away with the award.

Presently <Nakamura:player#641> is batting .297 with 5 home runs and 22 RBIs. He has played in 38 games and scored 16 times.
