The <Voyagers:team#1> kicked off a raucous celebration in New York tonight, as they edged the competition to win the Pro Baseball Experience Eastern Division.

"We all knew what was at stake and how important it was to finish strong. We're proud to be able to call ourselves champions of the Pro Baseball Experience Eastern Division," said shortstop <Eduardo Dinero:player#81>.

Team owner Ron Thorp said with his club's 64-36 record, they may not be considered odds-on favorites to win the World Series, but nobody should look past them or count them out.

"We are division champions for a reason," he said.

This was the 2nd division title in franchise history.
