Star of the Week Honored in MiLPBE
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Felipe Rios:player#582> of the <Dallas Dynamos:team#29> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Rios rocked opposing pitching for a .533 average (8-for-15), 3 home runs and 7 RBIs to come away with the award.

<Rios:player#582>'s current batting average stands at .313 and he has chalked up 4 home runs and 31 RBIs.
