15-K Game for Aviators Livingston
Everything was working for <Johnathon Livingston:player#337> today at The Island. He had the perfect delivery. The ball was moving. The knuckle curve was working.

In an unforgettable performance, the 26-year-old Livingston fanned 15 Voyagers and sparked the <Outer Banks Aviators:team#2> to a 7-4 victory over <New York:team#1>. He left Voyagers hitters mumbling and muttering at the plate. And when he needed a strikeout, he got it.

"I don't know if there are many times that I've seen him throw better," said Outer Banks manager  . "His location and command were really something." 

In addition to collecting 15 strikeouts over 7 innings, Livingston allowed 3 hits and 2 walks in a superlative outing. 

"I thought I'd make it easy on the guys today," Livingston said with a smile.

In 8 starts this season <Livingston:player#337> has rung up a 3-1 record and a 5.21 ERA.
