Stanton Pounds HR #200
200 home runs is a lot of home runs to hit. It's a number that very few players reach. Today <Jarrod Stanton:player#173> became a member of that exclusive club. He belted it at The Treehouse against the Sloths. But sometimes milestone homers don't win the game. The powerful <Utah:team#25> second baseman got all the headlines, but <San Antonio:team#9> came away with the victory. They beat the Railroaders 12-6.

During the postgame interview he told the press, "It's a big relief to get it over. I tried not to think about it, but it's kind of hard when you have a huge sign on the scoreboard staring at you every time you step up to the plate. The home run was nice, but I would have preferred to win the game."

His batting totals for the game showed 4 hits in 4 at-bats, 1 home run and 4 RBI.

The hardworking and dedicated Stanton also said, "I'll celebrate a little with my family tonight but not too much. This is not the last home run I will hit. I think I have a lot of baseball left in me and have other goals. I'll get back to work tomorrow."

During his career <Stanton:player#173> has chalked up 1137 hits and a .280 average with 200 home runs and 628 RBIs.
