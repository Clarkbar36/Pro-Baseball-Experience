PBE Selects Rookie Star of the Month
<Hendrix Lamar:player#407> is still a bit shy, but then, who could blame the newest Pro Baseball Experience Rookie of the Month honoree? He hasn't been around the league long enough to fully know the ropes yet, despite the fact that he's putting up veteran-like numbers.

In September the <Vancouver:team#11> hitter tagged opposing pitching for a .231 average with 15 hits, 1 home run and 6 RBIs.

So far this season <Lamar:player#407> has hit .267 with 6 home runs, 35 RBIs and scored 38 times.
