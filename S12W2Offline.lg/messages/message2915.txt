MiLPBE Player of the Week Selected
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Thomas Trey Oudekerk:player#508> of the <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Oudekerk rocked opposing pitching for a .526 average (10-for-19), 2 home runs and 9 RBIs to come away with the award.

During the current season <Oudekerk:player#508> is batting at a .286 clip with 2 home runs and 17 RBIs. He has played in 19 games and scored 12 times.
