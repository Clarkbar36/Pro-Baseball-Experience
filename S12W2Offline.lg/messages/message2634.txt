Dupree Named Top MiLPBE Hurler 
"The kid had it all working last month," a veteran teammate told reporters. "He keeps up those kind of numbers, we might have to start inviting him out with us after the games."

<Amp Dupree:player#529> put together a very solid month to take home the Minor League PBE's top pitching honor in June.

The 18-year-old reliever threw like a veteran. In no relief appearances he raked in no saves and 17 strikeouts in 33.2 innings as he put together his 3-1 record and 2.94 ERA.
