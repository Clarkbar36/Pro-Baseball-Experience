Star of the Week Awarded in PBE
So far in his young career, <Jeffrey Murphy:player#342> has kept a low profile, but after his performance at the plate last week, he attracted the notice of the rest of the Pro Baseball Experience in a big way as he was named the Player of the Week today for his efforts.

The 23-year-old <Outer Banks Aviators:team#2> second baseman hit at a torrid .462 clip as he collected 6 hits in 13 at-bats, 2 home runs, 8 RBIs and 3 runs scored.

In 42 games Murphy is hitting .214 this season with 33 hits, 7 home runs, 30 RBIs, 9 walks, .259 OBP and has scored 16 runs.
