Anchorage's Cena MiLPBE's Best
A red-hot bat made <Rob Cena:player#523> the obvious choice for this week's Minor League PBE Player of the Week.

The <Anchorage:team#16> left fielder laid down some numbers that no one else could match, including a .571 average on 8 hits in 14 at-bats, 3 home runs, 7 RBIs, and 4 runs scored. Say no more ... he got the award.

Thus far this year Cena is batting .253 with 8 home runs, 25 RBIs and 26 runs scored.
