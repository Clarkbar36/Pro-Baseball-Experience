Sloths Advance to World Series
The <San Antonio Sloths:team#9> are riding high after winning the Round 1 and eliminating the <Florida Space Rangers:team#24> by a series score of 3-1.

The final blow came tonight at The Treehouse, when San Antonio secured its spot in the World Series with a 7-5 victory.

"It feels good to put them away because we really didn't want to let them crawl back into this series," said catcher <Julian O'Sullivan:player#246>, who was named series MVP. "A team like that, you need to bury them when you get the chance."

O'Sullivan certainly helped his team's cause, as he hit .375 with a .412 on-base percentage in the series. He also chipped in 4 home runs, drove in 5 RBI and scored 6 runs.

The <San Antonio Sloths:team#9> will play against the <Outer Banks Aviators:team#2> in the next round. Outer Banks won their series against the <Death Valley Scorpions:team#10> 3 games to 0. The World Series schedule will be announced after the Round 1 finishes.
