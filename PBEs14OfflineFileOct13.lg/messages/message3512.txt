Week's Premier Player: Amarillo's Hill
It can be difficult for a young player to step out of the shadows and assert himself in the Minor League PBE, but last week <Cotton Hill:player#725> of the <Amarillo Armadillos:team#19> reminded everyone just why he's here as he threw up numbers that made him an easy selection for Player of the Week. Hill rocked opposing pitching for a .643 average (9-for-14), 2 home runs and 3 RBIs to come away with the award.
