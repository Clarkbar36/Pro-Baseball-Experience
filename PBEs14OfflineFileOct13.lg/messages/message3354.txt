Kowers in Custody Battle Over Beloved Pet
Cancun Toros' starting pitcher, <Penny Kowers:player#174>, is locked in an ugly custody battle for his chihuahua.

Police were recently called to his house after he came home to discover it had been 'petnapped'. He and his ex-girlfriend have been trading increasingly insulting barbs through the media at one another since their break-up and <Kowers:player#174> filed a police report and petitioned the court to order the pet be returned.

"She was always a bit of a loose cannon," said Cancun Toros teammate, <Matthew Auston:player#45>. "But it is pretty surprising she would kidnap his pet. That's pretty low, even for her. Besides, she hated that thing."
