"We made some bad pitches and he took advantage of it," said Vandals manager  . "That's the game, though. Don't make mistakes and you'll win ballgames. Make mistakes and, well, you saw what happened today." 

<Yeliboy Uecker:player#365> singled in the 2nd, hit a two-run triple in the 3rd, doubled in the 4th, singled in the 6th and singled in the 7th.
