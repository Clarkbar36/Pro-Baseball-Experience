Paquette Hurt Installing Fixture
Providence left fielder <Dexter Paquette:player#346> will miss at least a week after straining his back in a fall at his home. The injury occurred as he was attempting to install a light fixture. "I was standing on a step-stool and just kind of lost my footing and fell to the floor," said Paquette. "I was actually pretty lucky. I could have easily been injured much worse." Despite being laid up for the next week, Paquette says he's looking on the "bright side", so to speak. "Hey, at least I was able to get the light working before I fell!"
