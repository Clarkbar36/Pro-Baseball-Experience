'I Never Was Much of a Handyman', Says Injured Frey
Cancun reliever <Justin Frey:player#370> will miss up to 2 weeks of action after suffering a severely sprained index finger while making household repairs. "Next time I'll call a professional," joked Frey. "I never was much of a handyman anyway." Despite the levity of his comments, Frey said he was extremely disappointed to be missing so much time. "It kills me that my team has to suffer for my clumsiness. I just want to get back out there on the field and contribute as soon as possible."
