PBE Selects Rookie Star of the Month
<Manto Rune:player#478> is still a bit shy, but then, who could blame the newest Pro Baseball Experience Rookie of the Month honoree? He hasn't been around the league long enough to fully know the ropes yet, despite the fact that he's putting up veteran-like numbers.

In May the <Outer Banks:team#2> hitter tagged opposing pitching for a .340 average with 16 hits, no home runs and 3 RBIs.
