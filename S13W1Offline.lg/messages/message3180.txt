Pitcherman Walks Out to Music For At Least One More Year
In the modern age, it's not uncommon for players to have walkout music. But when <Fastguy Pitcherman:player#46> reported to camp, he was treated to a different kind of music; the theme from Jurassic Park.

"Dinosaurs walk among us!" shouted one teammate, before being pulled aside to explain the movie reference to one of the younger players. 

<Pitcherman:player#46> is used to the jokes.

"I've been doing this a lot of years," he said, wincing as he adjusted the ice packs on his knees. "Jokes come and go. But each day is another chance to walk out onto that field, smell that fresh-cut grass smell, and hear the sound of the fans. I'm not looking forward to giving it up. There's nothing else quite like it."
