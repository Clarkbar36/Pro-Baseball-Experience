Rose MiLPBE's #1 Pitcher in May
Any time a rookie makes a splash on the scene, it's got to be great for his career potential. Just ask <Ryan Rose:player#617>, who put together a stellar month out of the pen. The <Kansas City Hepcats:team#28> closer, 20, kept the opposition off balance all month as he held them to a .270 average and walked away with the Minor League PBE Pitcher of the Month award for May.

Rose posted a 2-0 mark and a 1.93 ERA in 6 relief appearances. In 9.1 innings, he had 3 saves, 7 strikeouts, and 5 walks.
