Faux Silences Utah
Magic was in the air and on the mound at Gibson Soundstage today as <Blake Faux:player#481> held the <Utah Railroaders:team#25> spellbound in his 2-0 shutout victory. The <Nashville Stars:team#27> pitcher went the distance, rang up 7 strikeouts, walked 1 and held the Railroaders to 4 hits to garner the win.

"He just had us in his thrall," Utah manager   said later. "We couldn't put anything together against him."
