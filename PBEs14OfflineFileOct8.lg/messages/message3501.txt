PBE News: Spring Training Begins
Spring training kicked off today with the arrival of pitchers and catchers. In the coming days, superstars and prospects alike will take the field, put on exhibition games and showcase their organization to a collection of fans, office personnel and media. 

Some players will arrive late, causing a stir, while others will work double time to make the Opening Day roster. Some will be sidelined, sending the medical staff into action. One thing is for certain, there will be a lot of nail-biting before Opening Day arrives.
