May's Starter of the Month Goes to Collins 
<Daniel Collins:player#722> took a much-deserved turn in the spotlight earlier today as he accepted the Minor League PBE Pitcher of the Month award for May.

The 18-year-old <Dynamos:team#29> starter is a relative newcomer to the league, but nonetheless racked up an impressive 2-1 won-lost record in 4 starts. This month he fanned 10 batters in 23 innings and compiled a 2.74 ERA.
