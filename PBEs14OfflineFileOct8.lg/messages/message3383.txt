Division Remains Up for Grabs, but Florida in Postseason
The <Florida Space Rangers:team#24> celebration was a bit downplayed today, as the team officially secured a playoff spot.

Left Fielder <Jake Stennett:player#87> said his club expected to have got to the playoffs and thus, it's not as exciting as it will be when the team wins the Pro Baseball Experience Eastern Division or advances to the World Series.

The Space Rangers record currently sits at 56-29 and they will be vying for the 1st Pro Baseball Experience championship in franchise history.
