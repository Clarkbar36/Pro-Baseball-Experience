Rodriguez Holds Providence Hitless
In a dominant outing, <Esteban Rodriguez:player#200> of the <Cancun Toros:team#26> totally silenced the bats of the <Providence Crabs:team#3>, finishing with a no-hitter.

In the Toros' 3-0 victory, Rodriguez faced only 28 batters, surrendered no hits, had 15 strikeouts and 1 walk.

"Honestly, I didn't even know the situation was what it was until the seventh inning," Cancun manager   said. "I happened to look up there to see how many hits we had gotten, and I happened to notice that they hadn't gotten any."

Commenting on the defeat, losing manager   told reporters in the clubhouse that he had a "pretty simple" analysis of the game.

"The Toros had all the hits and all the runs, so they won," he snapped. "But yeah, Rodriguez pitched a heck of a ballgame."
