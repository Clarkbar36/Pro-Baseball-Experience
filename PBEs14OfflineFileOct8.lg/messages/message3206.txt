Taylor Hurt While Cleaning Garage
Florida starting pitcher <Mark Taylor:player#527> will be sidelined for the next week after he injured his elbow while cleaning his garage.

"I whacked my elbow pretty hard against a shelf," explained Taylor. "I wasn't even able to bend it at first."

Tests showed Taylor to have an elbow contusion, which could take a week or more to heal.

"As much as I hate to be out of action, I don't want to take any chances, so I'm just going to rest it for now."
