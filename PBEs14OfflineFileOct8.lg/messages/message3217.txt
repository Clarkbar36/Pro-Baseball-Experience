Week's Top Player: Anchorage's Nakamura
So far in his young career, <Shinji Nakamura:player#641> has kept a low profile, but after his performance at the plate last week, he attracted the notice of the rest of the Minor League PBE in a big way as he was named the Player of the Week today for his efforts.

The 21-year-old <Anchorage Wheelers:team#16> second baseman hit at a torrid .500 clip as he collected 10 hits in 20 at-bats, no home runs, 3 RBIs and 2 runs scored.
