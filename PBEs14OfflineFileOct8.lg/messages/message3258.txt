Anchorage Relief Star Selected Best Pitcher
"The kid had it all working last month," a veteran teammate told reporters. "He keeps up those kind of numbers, we might have to start inviting him out with us after the games."

<Jose Forty-Three:player#462> put together a very solid month to take home the Minor League PBE's top pitching honor in June.

The 19-year-old reliever threw like a veteran. In no relief appearances he raked in no saves and 27 strikeouts in 36 innings as he put together his 4-1 record and 2.25 ERA.
