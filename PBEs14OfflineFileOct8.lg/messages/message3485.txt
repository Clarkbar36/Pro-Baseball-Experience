Coreys Brother Looks Less Effective During Spring Training
They say TV rots your brain. But can it hurt your game too? 

San Antonio Sloths' reliever <Coreys Brother:player#331> is looking less like a major league player this spring and many feel a TV commercial he filmed for the team over the winter might be to blame.

'We've seen a marked difference in Brother's effectiveness this spring.' said one scout on condition of anonymity. 'One hates to point to anything in particular, but they had him playing live games in the commercial. So that could have been it.'
