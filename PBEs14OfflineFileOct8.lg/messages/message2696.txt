No Hits for Borthwell, Streak Ends at 29 
Maybe it really is taboo to talk about a hitting streak before it's over. Hours after speaking to the press about his 29-game hitting streak, <New York:team#1> third baseman <Weldon Borthwell:player#29> went hitless in 4 at-bats today at USSSA Space Coast Coliseum.

The sudden hitting drought came as the Voyagers took the 5-3 win over the <Florida Space Rangers:team#24>.

"Nope, it's not magic," Borthwell said in his postgame press conference. "Nobody jinxed me. Streaks don't last forever. I've heard about it every day for weeks now. My roomie told me to get a hit before every game and wished me luck. I just ran out of hits."

A look at his season totals shows <Borthwell:player#29> with 14 home runs, .352 BA, .432 OBP, 50 RBIs and 44 runs scored.
